# IPFS vs traditional web
IPFS tell your what to look for, but traffitional web do where to look for.

In traditional web, if the server you access is comprimised, you probably get a modified verison of the content you are looking for. In most cases, the modified version contains trojan or virus. 

In IPFS, it won't happen. You can verify the hash.
